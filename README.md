# About Blackjack
Put together this game of blackjack for my portfolio, this mainly serves as a showcase of my game oriented programming skills. I have some experience using Java Swing and JOptionPane, but I decided to stick with main for my portfolio. When I completed this I noticed there were some issues and really inefficient parts about it, instead of rewriting the program better, I decided to leave it as-is and reflect on the possible improvements here.
